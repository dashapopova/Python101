# Mystem

**Mystem** is a Russian stemmer created by Iliya Segalovitch in 1998. You can download it for free, but you won't be able to see the code. The stemmer is used (and owned) by yandex.

Mystem is a little bit more than a simple stemmer, it has part-of-speech tagging, deals with homonymy, assigns probabilities to different parsings.

**For English**: the most famous stemmer is the **Porter stemmer**, created in 1980 by Martin Porter.

**Stemming** is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form. 
There are two error measurements in stemming algorithms, overstemming and understemming. **Overstemming** is an error where two separate inflected words are stemmed to the same root, but should not have been—a false positive. **Understemming** is an error where two separate inflected words should be stemmed to the same root, but are not—a false negative. Stemming algorithms attempt to minimize each type of error, although reducing one type can lead to increasing the other.

What types of languages, do you think, are hard to write a stemmer for?

**Lemmatisation** (or lemmatization) in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation)
